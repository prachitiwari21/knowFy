        <h2> What is personality?</h2>
      
        <p>At its most basic, personality is the characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that make a person unique. It is believed that personality arises from within the individual and remains fairly consistent throughout life.

            Examples of personality can be found in how we describe other people's traits. For instance, "She is generous, caring, and a bit of a perfectionist," or "They are loyal and protective of their friends."
            
            The word "personality" stems from the Latin word persona, which refers to a theatrical mask worn by performers in order to either project different roles or disguise their identities.</p>

        <p id="special">* While there are many different definitions of personality, most focus on the pattern of behaviors and characteristics that can help predict and explain a person's behavior.</p>

        <h2>How personality develops</h2>
        <p>There are a number of theories about personality, and different schools of thought in psychology influence many of these theories. Some theories describe how personalities are expressed, and others focus more on how personality develops.</p>
        <h4>Personality types</h4>
        <p>Type theories suggest that there are a limited number of personality types that are related to biological influences.
<br><br>
            One theory suggests there are four types of personality. They are:
            <div id="types">
            <b>Type A:</b>  Perfectionist, impatient, competitive, work-obsessed, achievement-oriented, aggressive, stressed <br>
            <b>Type B:</b>  Low stress, even-tempered, flexible, creative, adaptable to change, patient, tendency to procrastinate <br>
            <b>Type C:</b>  Highly conscientious, perfectionist, struggles to reveal emotions (positive and negative) <br>
            <b>Type D:</b>  Worrying, sad, irritable, pessimistic, negative self-talk, avoidance of social situations, lack of self-confidence, fear of rejection, appears gloomy, hopeless <br>
             </div> 
             <br> There are other popular theories of personality types such as the Myers-Briggs theory. The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator identifies a personality based on where someone is on four continuums: introversion-extraversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling, and judging-perceiving.</p>

             <p>Research on personality can yield fascinating insights into how personality develops and changes over the course of a lifetime. This research can also have important practical applications in the real world.
<br><br>
                For example, people can use a personality assessment (also called a personality test or personality quiz) to learn more about themselves and their unique strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. Some assessments might look at how people rank on specific traits, such as whether they are high in extroversion, conscientiousness, or openness.
               <br> <br>
                Other assessments might measure how specific aspects of personality change over time. Some assessments give people insight into how their personality affects many areas of their lives, including career, relationships, personal growth, and more.</p>
