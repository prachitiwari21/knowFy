             <p style="margin-top: 50px; ">Adherence to the proper etiquette for a business meeting establishes respect among meeting participants, helps the meeting begin and end on time, and fosters an atmosphere of cooperation. A lack of etiquette and poor planning are two of the main reasons why many business meetings fail. Teach your employees business meeting etiquette to ensure that your business's meetings are effective.
        </p> 
      </div>
<h3 id="first">1. Arrive Early (No Excuses)</h3>
<p> Arrive to the location of the business meeting at least 15 minutes early. This shows respect and allows you to find a seat and get situated before the meeting starts.
</p>
<h3 id="second">2. Follow the Agenda</h3>
The chairperson of the meeting should circulate a meeting agenda to each participant at least one week in advance. Participants should call the chairperson to express any concerns about the agenda at least 48 hours prior to the meeting. The chairperson and concerned participant will then have time to determine if changes need to be made. The agenda should also mention the meeting's start and ending times as well.

<h3 id="third">3. Be Thoroughly Prepared</h3>
Each participant should come to the meeting with all of the materials and data she will need and an understanding of the meeting topic. The whole purpose of the meeting is to discuss the topic at hand. You've wasted everyone's time if you are not prepared to contribute.

<h3 id="fourth">4. Take Regular Breaks</h3>
Meetings should have a break every two hours to ensure participants remain focused. Aim for breaks around 20 minutes long, and meal breaks around 30 minutes long.

<h3 id="fifth">5. Follow the Dress Code</h3>
The chairperson should indicate what kind of attire is required for the meeting, either business casual or business formal, and participants should follow that rule. A representative listing of the attire would be helpful as participants may have differing views on what business casual and business formal is. For example, when listing the meeting as business formal, you can indicate that a button-down shirt and khaki pants are sufficient.

<h3 id="sixth">6. Speak in Turn</h3>
Keep the meeting organized by only speaking when you have the floor. Ask questions during the designated question period, and raise your hand to be recognized by the chairperson as having the floor. Do not interrupt someone while they are speaking or asking a question.

<h3 id="seventh">7. Listen, Really Listen</h3>
You may find that many of the questions you have about a topic are answered by the content of the meeting. Listen attentively to the meeting and take notes. Active listening is respectful and gives you a solid base for formulating your response.

<h3 id="eight">8. Keep Calm</h3>
Avoid nervous habits such as tapping a pen on the table, making audible noises with your mouth, rustling papers or tapping your feet on the floor. This is distracting to other participants and makes you look anxious, even if you are not.

<h3 id="ninth">9. Be Polite With Your Phone </h3>
Turn off your cell phone prior to the start of the meeting. If you are expecting an urgent call, then set your phone to vibrate and excuse yourself from the meeting if the call comes in. Unless laptop computers have been approved for the meeting, turn yours off and lower the screen so that you do not obstruct anyone's view.

<h3 id="last">10. Don't Bring Guests</h3>
Do not bring unannounced guests to a meeting. If you have someone you would like to bring to a meeting, then contact the chairperson for permission to bring your guest. If permission is not granted, then do not bring him.
