           <p>Dating etiquette comes into play whether you know you date well or are getting to meet your date for the first time after meeting online. If you want a second and third date it is critical that your first date goes off well. If you want the relationship to move forward, you need to be able to make sure the person thinks you are worth it.  
        </p> 
<h3 id="first">1. Don't be late.</h3>
<p> This is kind of a given. Considering how many people don’t see punctuality as a virtue, this ranks right at the top of our list of dating etiquette. And no, it is not only for the first dates, but for all the ones that follow. Just as you would make the effort in your professional life, it is expected that you’d give preference to your personal life as well. It is absolutely wrong to keep the other person waiting on a first date. First impressions do count! Being kept waiting on a first date is not good!
    Being on time shows that you value the other person’s time as well. This helps kick-start the date on the right note. Whether you want to add this to your first coffee date etiquette or your first lunch date together, this is an important consideration as first impressions count.  
</p>

<h3 id="second">2. First date etiquette includes not digging the past.</h3>
This first date may be the beginning of something new and special with the other person. You must ensure that you don’t bring the baggage of your past to the date. Plus, you must not try to dig the past in your date’s life. Discussing exes even before you’ve had the chance to learn about the other person’s likes and dislikes in the romantic sense is among the worst dating etiquette. First date etiquette- do not bring up past. Be sensitive about stories from your past. Don’t volunteer too much information or too soon, nor ask questions about past relationships unless offered. This probably tops the list of things you should not do on the first date. This is your first date with someone new, not a drink with a pal and a shoulder to cry on, even if this is a first date with an old-friend-turned-potential-relationship. So do make this a start of something wonderful.

<h3 id="third">3. Avoid using your phone.</h3>
Technology has its own pluses and minuses. And dating and relationships is a tricky space. You might be a busy person who receives a lot of phone calls and text messages. But on your first date, your time and attention should be reserved for the other person exclusively. Keep your phone in your pocket, or your bag, focus on the person without any distractions! In case of an emergency, it is easier and more polite to excuse yourself with the other person’s permission and keep the call short and crisp.

<h3 id="fourth">4.  Being yourself is a crucial online dating etiquette.</h3>
Well, you should be yourself at all times and in any kind of dating setup. But this is even more crucial if you first connected online. Given that people on dating apps often pretend to be what they’re not, this makes for crucial online dating etiquette. If you change your mind mid-way, know that it’s perfectly okay to say so. Instead of putting on a show in order to make your date likes you, focus on presenting your true self. Remember that pretense may get you a second date or even a third, but it won’t take you far. There are no set rules about it. Just go with your gut and do what feels right at the moment to the both of you. Remember to seek and give consent, if you do plan to take things to the next level on a first date.

<h3 id="fifth">5. Avoid controlling the conversation.</h3>
As the conversation begins to flow, it is important that you both hear each other out. This is a conversation, and this date is not just about you. Talk about hobbies, passions, about each others jobs, the books and movies you enjoy, keep the flow. Avoid potential topics around long term promises, marriage and children this time round, the first date is more exploratory than to pin the person down. Even if this is an arranged date! It is your first chance to get to know the other person well. So avoid controlling the conversation and steering in a pre-determined direction. There are some well-thought of questions you can ask your date to know them better – and to include them in the conversation. Proper dating etiquette dictates that your date comfortable enough that they can talk without inhibitions too.

<h3 id="sixth">6. Marriage or children should not come up in this conversation yet.</h3>
It is just your first date with the other person and you do not want to make them uncomfortable with long term commitments of marriage or children. How can you talk about the future when you are not even sure about the second date? These conversations are appropriate only when you have a real thing going and can see your future with this person. Bringing them up too early on – especially on a first date – can be a total deal-breaker.

<h3 id="seventh">7. Pay attention to basic table manners.</h3>
A proper dating etiquette to portray you as a proper, well-groomed person. The way you eat and behave while eating says a lot about your personality. You must make sure that your table manners are on point and you do not make a fool of yourself. It is not about being knowledgeable about wine pairings or the correct use of cutlery, but a basic courtesy you show the other person. Bad habits are always noticed and can make you undateable, especially when the person is still creating a first impression about you.

<h3 id="eight">8. Asking questions is good dating etiquette.</h3>
The first date is the chance to get to know the other person better. So you should make it a point to ask appropriate questions to your date. This goes on to show that you’re interested in learning more about them. This can make you more at ease in each other’s company. If you have found yourself struggling to come up with the right questions in the past, read up a little about appropriate first date conversation starters.

<h3 id="ninth">9. Avoid bragging. </h3>
You may have many an accomplishment to boast of. Your job, swanky car, plush apartment, social status, educational background…the works. But rubbing it in your date’s face qualifies as the worst dating etiquette.  Trust us when we say, no one likes a show-off. If your date does not have the same level of accomplishments, you can leave them feeling belittled. If their success outshines yours, you will make a total fool of yourself. And anyway, someone looking for a relationship would dismiss you right there and then if you are more ego and less person.

<h3 id="last">10. Avoid overindulgence.</h3>
The idea is to impress your date right? Why screw up the whole thing by indulging and then regretting it later on what things could be like. Too much drinking on the first date can make you lose control and become sloppy. The messy side of you is something that you do not want to show the other person on the first date. So avoid overindulgence in alcohol and be in control of what you do and say.</div>
